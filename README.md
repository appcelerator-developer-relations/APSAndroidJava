This is the complete sample code for the
[Quick Start Guide for Android APS SDK](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Quick_Start_Guide_for_Android_APS_SDK).

Before running this sample, copy the `appcelerator-sdk-android-<VERSION>.jar` file
to the `libs` folder in Android project.

Link the `android-support-v4.jar` and `android-support-v7-appcompat.jar` libraries
from the Android SDK to the project.

In the `MainActivity.java` file, replace the `APS_APP_KEY` variables with your APS application key.

You should now be able to build the project.
